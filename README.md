# Hello, nerds

Hey! Iâ€™m Mariano Rivas, software developer and new media artist. I work as Head of Front-end at [TrueNorth](https://truenorth.co). By having a generalist technical skillset, I'm able to participate in a variety of projects in different stages of the creative process, from conception to execution. I host all of my personal projects here. https://colormono.com
